- Developed a breast cancer classification model combining a fine-tuned VGG-16 CNN for feature extraction and traditional ML classifiers (SVM, MLP, Random Forest) for final prediction.
- Improved upon baseline model (AUC = 0.95) by achieving AUC = 0.98 using SVM, with further performance gains using MLP and Random Forest.
- Trained and evaluated the model on the INBreast dataset using Google Colab; leveraged whole-image mammogram model architecture by <a href="https://github.com/lishen/end2end-all-conv?tab=readme-ov-file#whole-image-model-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Li Shen</a>.
